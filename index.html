      Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy
      lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
      Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green
      planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a
      pretty neat idea.
      This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for
      pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely
      concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't
      the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
      And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the
      ones with digital watches.
      Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees
      in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have
      left the oceans.
      And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying
      how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in
      Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew
      how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one
      would have to get nailed to anything.
      Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe
      occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
      This is not her story.
      But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.
      It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy - not an Earth book,
      never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
      Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
      in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of
      Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard either.
      Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one - more popular than the
      Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more
      controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some
      More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
      In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's
      Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge 
      and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly
      inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.
      First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters
      on its cover.
      But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the
      story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very
      simply.
      It begins with a house.
      Chapter 1
      The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its own and looked over a
      broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means - it was about thirty years
      old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which
      more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
      The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only
      because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had
      moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark haired
      and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always
      used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he always used
      to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too - most of his friends
      worked in advertising.
      It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted to knock down his house and build an
      bypass instead.
      At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up,
      wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to
      the bathroom to wash.
      Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub.
      Shaving mirror - pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer
      through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles. He shaved them off,
      washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth.
      Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn.
      The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with.
      The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.
      He stared at it.
      "Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed.
      Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he
      was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must
      have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. "Yellow," he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.
      He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry
      about something that seemed important. He'd been telling people about it, telling people about it at great
      length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces.
      Something about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no
      one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he'd
      decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn't have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. 
      God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror.
      He stuck out his tongue. "Yellow," he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of
      something to connect with.
      Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was
      advancing up his garden path.
      Mr L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon-based life form descended
      from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council. Curiously
      enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though
      intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid
      characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced
      stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.
      He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man. Today he was
      particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job - which was to
      see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way before the day was out.
      "Come off it, Mr Dent,", he said, "you can't win you know. You can't lie in front of the bulldozer
      indefinitely." He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it.
      Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.
      "I'm game," he said, "we'll see who rusts first."
      "I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it," said Mr Prosser gripping his fur hat and rolling it round
      the top of his head, "this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!"
      "First I've heard of it," said Arthur, "why's it going to be built?"
      Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again.
      "What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a bypass. You've got to build bypasses."
      Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point A to point B very fast whilst other
      people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in
      between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people of point B are so keen
      to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people of point A are so keen to get there. They
      often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted to be.
      Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient
      point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes
      over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His
      wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't know why - he just liked axes. He
      flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.
      He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously
      somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him.
      Mr Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time you
      know."
      "Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman
      arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd come to
      demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and
      charged me a fiver. Then he told me."
      "But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine month."
      "Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't
      exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or
      anything."
      "But the plans were on display ..."
      "On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them."
      "That's the display d
