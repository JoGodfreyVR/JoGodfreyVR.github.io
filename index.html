    <h3>Tech Girl</h3>
    <h4> Inspiring young girls to get involved in tech with creative coding workshop </h4>
    <p class="date"> March 2019 </p>
    <p> 
        I prepared two workshops for girls in primary schools with the aim to inspire and interest in coding. I had recently discovered Processing.io as a tool to code creatively in. As it inheiritly inspires playfulness and curiousity I decided to work with this tool. 
        I found that encouraging the girls to tweak parts of the code and work out what the parameters did them selves gave them the confidence to go and do their own thing with it.

    <p> 
        As an approach to find out how we can get the most educational benefit out of media that young people are comfortable with I conducted research and created three educational videos.
        The videos were based around the techniques we use to capture electromagnetic information from space. I incorporated some detectors and tools that were currently being improved upon in Cardiff Universities department of Physics and Astronomy.
