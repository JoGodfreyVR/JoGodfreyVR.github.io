    <h3>Tech Girl</h3>
    <h4> Inspiring young girls to get involved in tech with creative coding workshop </h4>
    <p> 
        I prepared two workshops for girls in primary schools with the aim to inspire and interest in coding. I had recently discovered Processing.io as a tool to code creatively in. As it inheiritly inspires playfulness and curiousity I decided to work with this tool. 
        I found that encouraging the girls to tweak parts of the code and work out what the parameters did them selves gave them the confidence to go and do their own thing with it.

    <h3>Music Video</h3>
    <h4>Creative music video</h4>
    <p>
         After hearing her play at a concert with Sofar Sounds I approached Kerensa to discuss collaborating on making a music video. We met up for a discussion in which she showed me some of her new music and her ideas for them. We story boarded this together and came up with some ideas to work on.</a>

        <h3>Science Communication Research</h3>
        <h4>Investigation and creation of gamification in educational videos</h4>
        <p> 
            As an approach to find out how we can get the most educational benefit out of media that young people are comfortable with I conducted research and created three educational videos.
            The videos were based around the techniques we use to capture electromagnetic information from space. I incorporated some detectors and tools that were currently being improved upon in Cardiff Universities department of Physics and Astronomy.
